# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- `PROTONMAIL_CONFIRM_DESTRUCTIVE=true` — opt-in gate that requires `confirmed: true` on `send_email`, `reply_to_email`, `forward_email`, `send_draft`, and `delete_email` before executing; Claude pauses and asks before irreversible operations
- `proton-mail-bridge-client setup-claude-desktop` — top-level CLI command for the interactive Claude Desktop setup wizard; works from any install (npm global, Homebrew, source)
- `proton-mail-bridge-client --version` / `-v` — prints the package version and exits
- **npm package** published to the registry: `npm install -g proton-mail-bridge-client`
- **Homebrew tap**: `brew tap googlarz/tap && brew install proton-mail-bridge-client`
- README: "Why CLI?" section with pipe, cron, and scripting examples
- README: Recommended system prompt template for safer Claude Desktop defaults
- `runtime-status` now shows `confirmDestructive` flag state

### Fixed
- CLI reported `version: 1.6.0` regardless of actual package version — now reads from `package.json` dynamically
- Windows: `spawn EINVAL` error during Claude Desktop installer (`npm.cmd` now uses `shell: true`)

### Changed
- README Install section restructured — npm and Homebrew are now the primary install paths; source install moved to a collapsible section
- `package.json` `files` field cleaned up — Docker files and internal docs removed from published package

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- Full CLI/MCP parity — every MCP tool is callable from the CLI
- `notify` daemon — watches INBOX via IMAP IDLE and sends a system notification (macOS/Linux) on new mail; emits JSON to stdout for scripting
- Ambient background notifications with SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful shutdown and automatic reconnect

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- Full CLI parity with the MCP surface — all read, triage, compose, and mailbox commands available in the terminal
- `--json` flag on all commands for machine-readable output
- Stdin body pipe for `send`, `reply`, and `forward`

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- Full CLI parity milestone — CLI now matches MCP tool surface completely
- Batch operations from the terminal: `batch archive`, `batch trash`, `thread-action`

### Fixed
